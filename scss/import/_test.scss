// OFFCANVAS - tester classes
// ==========================
// Classes used to prove that Offcanvas is working, during development of this jQuery plugin.
// You don't need these, but I have kept them in, and I have commented out their `@import` in `offcanvas.scss`.
// Best practice for production is simply to `@include` one of the `@mixin`s directly in your `body` styling
// (see `offcanvas.scss`).

.offcanvas-over-left {
  @include offcanvas-over-left;
}

.offcanvas-over-right {
  @include offcanvas-over-right;
}

.offcanvas-push-left {
  @include offcanvas-push-left;
}

.offcanvas-push-right {
  @include offcanvas-push-right;
}

.offcanvas-under-left {
  @include offcanvas-under-left;
}

.offcanvas-under-right {
  @include offcanvas-under-right;
}
